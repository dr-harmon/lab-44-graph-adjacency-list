# Lab 44: Graph Adjacency List

In this lab, we will improve the performance of the graph ADT by converting it from an edge list implementation to an adjacency list. Most of the work has been done already. Your tasks are:

1. Implement the `Vertex::isAdjacentTo` method.
2. Implement the `Vertex::incidentEdges` method.

When you have finished, make sure all unit tests pass.
